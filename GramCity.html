              GramCity wants to explore how they can help their users find great
              photo-ops near them. GramCity wants to design a feature to help

              Users spend a lot of time searching for the good photo spots that
              would meet their expectations and plan for the trip. They also
              don’t want to miss out on good photo spots that are already near
              them.

              I followed the design sprint process which is a five-day process
              developed by Google Ventures to answer the business questions
              through synthesizing, designing, prototyping and testing the ideas
              with potential users.

            <p>
              For the second day of the design sprint, I started off looking to
              other products that are solving a problem similar to the one I was
              trying to solve. I studied trip planning apps, local guide apps,
              photo sharing social media app, and map/location based service
              provider finder apps.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span>• Foursquare: </span> I was mainly inspired by how they
              organized the detail page of the place.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>• Visit A City: </span> I was inspired by their “Explore”
              page and how they organized “My Plans”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>• Roadtrippers: </span> I studied how users can make a trip
              plan and how the app shows the plan on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>• Instagram: </span> I observed their UI - particularly
              their location based posts and tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>• OpenTable: </span> I looked at their UI - particularly the
              search based on location.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>• Geolocation apps: </span> Geolocation apps make users'
              experiences more comfortable and amusing. Due to their usefulness,
              location-based services occupy an important niche in the mobile
              app market. I learned that key features include GPS coordinates,
              location tracking, and map integration through research.
            </p>
            <p>CRAZY 8’S</p>
            <p>
              With all the insights from the research as well as observing other
              products, I decided that the critical screen would be the one that
              displays map view (location based) with photo spots with a brief
              information of one selected spot. I went on to do Crazy 8s and
              sketched out 8 screens to try out different variations of the most
              critical screen.
            </p>

            <p>SOLUTION SCREENS</p>
            <p>
              I sketched the screens that would come before and after the
              critical screen. The screen that would come before the critical
              screen is a notification pop-up asking users to turn on “allow
              always” in location settings so that the app can notify users if
              photo spots are nearby. The screen that would come after the
              critical screen is a detail page about the photo spots providing a
              brief explanation about the spot, information, rating, reviews,
              photos and tips.

              After establishing the critical screen, I sketched out the screens
              that follow the critical screen. Throughout creating a storyboard,
              I ensured to meet the Personas’ goals.

            <p>Screen #5</p>

              Users can check all the information about the places, address,
              opening hours, ratings, reviews, tips, and photos taken from
              others. This will help users to decide whether they will visit or
              not and reduce the risk of getting disappointed after visiting the
              place.

            <p>SPRINT DAY 4 - PROTOTYPE</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              In order to test the functionality of the design, I built out the
              bare essential screens of the prototype. The key was to work as
              fast and as lean as I can, while making sure the design is a
              realistic façade. I quickly created a realistic prototype of the
              screens I sketched in an 8 panel storyboard. I chose dark mode
              screens to highlight the photos because photos are one of the
              important aspects in the app. Users of GramCity are also very
              likely to be users of Instagram which uses dark mode screens. By
              using the same dark mode screens, users feel familiar to the
              screens and feel like using the app is an extension of Instagram
              activity which makes them feel comfortable with overall experience
              with the app.

              <span>Participants:</span> I recruited five individuals ranging
              from the age 25-31 who were comfortable navigating digital
              interfaces and regularly use mobile apps. All five like to go to
              instagrammable places, take photos and post on Instagram.

            <p>FINDINGS</p>
            <p>
              1. Participants thought ratings, reviews, and the number of
              reviews were important to check to decide whether going to the
              photo spots or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Participants’ common pattern was to bookmark the spots first.
              They go through spots, bookmark all the spots they are interested
              in, and decide later whether to add to a plan or not. So, it was a
              good decision to have both bookmark and plan on the bottom menu
              bar for users’ easy navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Participants found the options like “Most Popular”, “Trending”,
              “Best Reviews” and “Near Me” were helpful to quickly find photo
              spots that they would be interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. All participants said that the app would be useful to find
              photo spots.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Participants liked that the app showed the route of the plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Because of the timeline to make MVPs, I didn’t add a page of
              “Get direction”, but the participant wanted to check the direction
              from where the participant is as well as from place to place so
              that she doesn’t have to check Google Map. Also, the participant
              wanted to see how long it takes to get to the place.
            </p>
            <p>
              7. One participant usually checks both Google and Instagram to see
              the photo spots and how people take good pictures.

              4. Adding a color outline around the picture on the map to make
              the most popular places more pop out or put a star icon for a must
              visit spot.

            <p>
              It was a new experience to use GV design sprint to rapidly design
              and test the prototype. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process
              and it was satisfying to be able to design solutions quickly, test
              the prototype and get feedback. GV design sprint helped me to
              focus on the prioritized functions and I learned that good
              solutions don’t always take a long process.
