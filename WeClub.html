            <p>WHAT IS THE CONTEXT?</p>
            <p>
              Many sports require more than two people to play games. Many of my
              friends who moved to a new city have been <span>trying to find a local
                sports club to play the sports game, but didn’t know where or how
                to find the clubs.</span> I could relate to them as I had tried to find a
              group of people to enjoy the same fitness activities.
              <br /><br />Also, when I was starting to work out, it was <span>difficult to
                make it a daily routine.</span> I have found other people also feel the
              same <span>because there’s nothing really pushing them to do so and no
                tools to help them to keep motivating them.</span>

          </div>
          <div class="sec_3_contents_box the_problem">
            <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
            <p>1. Finding a Local Sports Club</p>
            <p>
              People who want to play sports have to find players with the same
              interest in their area. If they don’t have a network to meet other
              players, this can be difficult to accomplish.
            </p>
            <p>2. Making a good habit (Challenge)</p>
            <p>
              People find it difficult to create good habits or daily routines.
              Committing to a challenge provides the boost to start making a
              change. Doing a challenge with other people is a great way to keep
              people motivated and people are more likely to stick to their
              commitment.

              • Location based local sports clubs/activities finder (wherever
              location user wants) - to connect with people who share your
              interests.

            <p>
              WeClub is a mobile application that helps people find local sports
              clubs to join or start their own club. It allows people to connect
              with others with the same interest. Another feature is Challenge
              to motivate people to make a good change in their daily routine.
              The app provides challenges that are not overwhelming, but
              something manageable so that people feel like trying and not get
              discouraged. Joining a challenge will help people to get started
              and keep motivated by doing it with a supportive community.

            <p>SECONDARY RESEARCH</p>
            <p>
              My original idea was to help people build a good routine/habit. To
              understand how to form a routine and the benefits of building a
              good routine, I did research through published reports and
              articles online.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>KEY FINDINGS</p>
            <p>
              Many people try to create a healthy habit or daily routine, but
              often fail. This suggests that creating a new habit or daily
              routine is difficult. Having people motivated to keep going with
              the challenge would be much helpful.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>To make a daily routine:</p>
            <p>1. Decide what needs to be in your routine</p>
            <p>2. Set small goals.</p>
            <p>3. Layout a plan.</p>
            <p>4. Be consistent with time.</p>
            <p>5. Make it fun!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sec_3_contents_box">
            <p>PRIMARY RESEARCH</p>
            <p>
              To better understand people’s recent behavior when trying to make
              a new habit/routine, I spoke with five individuals who were
              selected from a screener survey. Each interviewee participated in
              a 30 - 45 minute interview either in person or virtually over
              Zoom. They shared openly about their daily routines and experience
              with trying to build a good habit or daily routine.

            <p>USER INTERVIEW FINDINGS X 5 PEOPLE</p>
            <p>
              Through the interviews, I learned not only what encourages or
              discourages people when trying to make a new habit/routine,
              <span
                >but also discovered that four out of five interviewees recently
                tried to find an activity group related to sports/fitness
                activities that they were interested in.</span>
                <br>
                <p>Based on this new key finding, I decided to learn more about the experience of finding local sport clubs/fitness groups. <span>I quickly moved on with the 2nd round of interviews with the same four people who tried to find sport clubs/fitness groups. </span></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  What people who play sports or enjoy fitness activities are looking for:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Finding the local sports clubs</p>
                <p>People want easy ways to find local sports clubs and reach out.</p>
                <p>2. Connecting with like-minded people</p>
                <p>It is difficult to meet people who play the same sports or enjoy the same activities if people don’t have a network.</p>
                <p>3. Motivation</p>
                <p>People find it difficult to motivate themselves to start making a good habit and stay motivated.</p>
                <p>4. A guidance for setting goals</p>
                <p>People often don’t know how/what to start when building healthy habits/routines and need guidance for setting SMART goals: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound objectives.</p>

            <p>
              Colors are carefully selected considering color theory and emotional connotation. For the primary color, I opted for <span>pink-red color that offers a sense of energy, fun, friendliness and promotes motivation with a positive attitude.</span> I specifically picked pink-red color because it gives a softer feel than red. <span>Green is the secondary color which is associated with life and growth.</span> Green is used in limited areas. To create a simple, clean UI design, I tried to minimize the number of colors with hues and used more achromatic colors.

              For good legibility, font size is at least 15 and over. I chose Roboto for the clean, modern font look and legibility. For a very large header, I chose Work Sans to add a little playful element, but still has the clean and modern look.

            <p>USABILITY TESTING - 5 MODERATED TESTINGS</p>
            <p>Key findings for the improvement:</p>
            <p>1. Participants didn’t quickly decide what option to choose on the log-in page.</p>
            <p>2. Challenge detail page lacked some information that participants wanted to know.</p>
            <p>3. When creating a club, users wanted more settings.</p>
            <p>4. Users use bookmark often, but it takes two (there was no direct bookmark navigation on every screen)</p>

            <p>ITERATION</p>
            <p>1. Improved onboarding process by updating the CTA buttons.</p>
            <p>2. Added more information about challenges.</p>
            <p>3. Added an image icon on creating a club page.</p>
            <p>4. Made the club categories scroll horizontally for users to explore more categories.</p>

            <p>2ND ROUND USABILITY TESTING </p>
            <p>Through the 2nd round testing, I wanted to observe how users experienced the app with its iterations.</p>
            <p>Iterations to consider:</p>
            <p>1. Allow users to set up notifications to remind them to do the challenge or attend the club event.</p>
            <p>2. Add the level of challenges showing how difficult the challenges are.</p>
            <p>3. Add the recommended challenges for each user’s level.</p>

              My next step would be incorporating more gamification elements in rewarding to motivate users and visualize the progress. Creating some incentives for people who complete challenges would boost their motivation and give them more sense of achievement.

            <p>WHAT I LEARNED</p>
            <p>
              I really enjoyed working on the capstone project “We Club” and seeing how this mobile service can impact people’s lives. It was very interesting to test what people would look for while using the app. WeClub is also a special project for me that resonates with my experiences. I always had difficulties in finding people who would do the same sports/fitness activities with me. By conducting user research, I have found that many people felt the same way I did. My intention is to respond to people’s wants to connect with other like-minded people and to get motivated to make changes for healthier lives. I believe that creating supportive communities will bring benefits to people’s lives.
